Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, the objective was to assess the credit risk of loans using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we aimed to predict whether a loan was likely to default based on financial information from the dataset, using a classification approach.

Data Information: The dataset contained various financial attributes related to individual loans, with the target variable loan_status indicating the loan's status (e.g., default or non-default).

Objective: We needed to predict the likelihood of a loan defaulting, classified as 1 (default) or 0 (non-default). By examining loan_status, we could determine the distribution of defaults and non-defaults in the data.

Machine Learning Process:

Data Preparation: The data was divided into features (X) and labels (y), followed by a train-test split to enable performance evaluation on unseen data.

Model Selection: A LogisticRegression model was chosen.

Training: The model was trained on the training dataset.

Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance was measured using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics on both training and test data.

Results

Below are the accuracy, precision, and recall scores from the LogisticRegression model:

Machine Learning Model 1 (Logistic Regression):

- Testing Accuracy: Approximately 99.6%, which means that this model is very accurate

- Precision and Recall:
For the healthy loan class (0):
Precision: very High at a perfect score of 100%, indicating strong identification of non-defaults.
Recall: very High at a perfect score of 100%, suggesting few actual non-defaults were missed.

For the high-risk loan class (1):
Precision: Lower than for the healthy loan class, indicating a greater chance of false positives.
Recall: Moderate, showing some defaults were missed.

Summary


I would recommend The LogisticRegression model because it achieved high accuracy in predicting loan defaults and has a great precision-recall balance.

Healthy loan (0) performed best because its precision and recall was perfect at 100%. However, high-risk loans performed well too. The numbers just show that it's able to predict high-risk loans for the most part.

Yes, performance does depend on the problem we're trying to solve. If minimizing financial losses is what's important here, then having a model that has a higher recall and precision for high-risk loans (1) would be more important. It depends on what the goal is here. If predicting high-risk loans (1s) is a priority, increasing the recall for high-risk loans might be advisable, possibly through further tuning or experimenting with other classification models.
